PyGLPK Readme
=============

========
Overview
========

PyGLPK is a Python module which encapsulates the functionality of the `GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_. The GLPK allows one to specify linear programs (LPs) and mixed integer programs (MIPs), and to solve them with either simplex, interior-point, or branch-and-bound algorithms. The goal of PyGLPK is to give one access to all documented functionality of GLPK.
